vector (1.2, 1.2) with circular constraint force with center and dist
With vector (1.4, 1.4) with rod constraint between this and previous particle with dist as parameter

			Damp		dt
Euler			0.98		0.13    Circular constraint is no longer stricly enforced
Midpoint		0.98		0.1966	Unstable, as the 2 particles keep gaining velocity and leave screen
Runge-Kutta		0.98		0.1966	Unstable, as the 2 particles keep gaining velocity and leave screen
